/**
 * 
 * Simulated annealing (SA) is a local search algorithm with the extension to
 * sometimes accept worse solutions. To find the global optima, they move from
 * solution to solution in the search space by applying local changes.<br>
 * <br>
 * Each SA algorithm keeps track of a temperature <i>T</i> which is gradually
 * decreased over time (usually in a {@link AbstractCoolingScheme cooling
 * scheme}). Worse solutions may be accepted in dependence of the absolute
 * difference to the current solution and this temperature.<br>
 * <br>
 * The dependency is such that the choice between the previous and current
 * solution is almost random when <i>T</i> is large, but increasingly selects
 * the better or "downhill" solution (for a minimization problem) as <i>T</i>
 * goes to zero. The allowance for "uphill" moves potentially saves the method
 * from becoming stuck at local optima.
