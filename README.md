Meta Heuristics 4 Java (MH4J) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MH4J/MetaHeuristics4Java.png)](https://travis-ci.org/MH4J/MetaHeuristics4Java)
===

MH4J is a java framework that enables you to solve optimization problems using metaheuristics.Our aim is to offer a wide range of different algorithms which can be easily integrated into your application.

Currently the following metaheuristics are implemented:

* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithms

Future releases will presumably contain these algorithms:

* Ant Algorithms
* Tabu-Search

Goals
---

Among others these goals are the ones that are most important to us while developing the API:

* easy to use (rapid development)
* usage of Java Generics
* highly configurable
* well supported concurrency
* fast (efficient CPU and memory usage)
* high test coverage (we use [TestNG]( http://testng.org ))

Specific Features
---

* a broad **range of algorithms**: you can choose between different metaheuristics to solve your optimization problem
* **examples** and tutorials: we will help you getting started with MH4J by giving you an example implementation for each feature and also some tutorials in this wiki.
* **experimentation** framework: in the future we will give you an additional framework that lets you test and compare your application 
 and visualize the data

Usage
---

To explain the usage of all the different metaheuristics we have created some [example implementations](https://github.com/MH4J/MetaHeuristics4Java/tree/develop/MetaHeuristics4Java-Examples) for you. There will also be a tutorial section where we explain these implementations in some detail and help you get started with your own project.

Installation
---

Binaries are available in the [Download Section](https://github.com/MH4J/MetaHeuristics4Java/downloads).
